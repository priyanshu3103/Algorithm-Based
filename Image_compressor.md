# Image Compressor

  It is an image compressor UI design, that is used to compress images or directories it has two features one is compress single image, In single image 
compressor option we can compress only single image and the image quality is better like original, In that feature we can directly access image on any folder
and the compress image are also saved in that similar folder also we can change the quality of the image.
  
  In multiple image compressor option, It will access multiple images from directories and it has two file one is source_file and second is destination_file,
also we can change the image quality.


For designing that project ,I am use the pyqt5 python library as GUI for creating simple user interface to compress image in easiest way and it is easy to 
understand.And  used multiple methode of that library.
